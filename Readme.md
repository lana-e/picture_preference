# Picture Preference From Scratch

I've learned a lot over the past year, and I've (hopefully) become a much better programmer as well. As such, I wanted to dig back into this personal project that I made in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic and improve or revamp some aspects of it with the things that I've learned in jobs or in my graduate program at UC Berkeley.

When I looked back at my old code, though, frankly, I had no idea what was going on. It was a piecemeal project, incorporating elements from a bunch of random online forums to drag myself to approximations of solutions to the obstacles I faced. Don't get me wrong, it was an incredibly fun and fulfilling project, but it was a project for learning, and a lot of learning is learning what to avoid next time. Some of those lessons are hard-coded into the old version of the project, inextricably linked to crucial pieces of code or architecture that I cannot remove without breaking down the whole thing and starting from scratch. So, this is what this branch is for. I'll be starting from absolute zero, completely redoing the project and structuring it in a way that's more understandable and more iterable. I really like this idea, and I want to continue to work on it and make it something that grows with me, instead of a project that falls by the wayside as I develop other things.
